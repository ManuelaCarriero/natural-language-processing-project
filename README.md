# Protein sequences embedding using Natural Language Processing (NLP) method
## Summary
Project for pattern recognition exam. The aim is to extract important features which characterize protein sequences of the Spike (S) protein, that is found on the outside of the SARS-CoV-2 virus particle. 
We train a LSTM neural network to classify Spike protein sequences according to their host species in order to get the embedding weights, that is the representation of proteins sequences of
symbols as continuous vectors. Brian Hie et al. in *Learning the language of viral evolution and escape* show that the human sequences are very similar to those
of bat and pangolin sequences. Hence we would like to assess at least these results, even though using an other neural network model. In the end, besides this, we find that human protein sequences arrange themselves in a more
regular shape with respect to animals, which suggests a "more regular and less random" variability in Spike protein sequences from human host species.

A note: this approach uses supervised machine learning model (the neural network has to classify sequences according to their host species) and so this method to represent protein sequences is enriched with prior biological knowledge.
This same concept is widely exploited and examinated in the article *Learning the protein language: Evolution, structure, and function* by Tristan Bepler and Bonnie Berger.
